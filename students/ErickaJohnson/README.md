 ##Work
 I'm a research scientist with the genome sciences department at the UW. These days, most of my work centers around genome editing and tissue culture in order to better understand regulatory elements and gene expression.
  
  ##Volunteering
 I volunteer a lot. I like giving my time to fix broken things and to making the world a better place, any way that I can.


##Fun
  I love Seattle! I love being so close to so many micro brews, so many amazing places to camp and hike, so many book-ish people. I'm also a bit addicted to [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) and (with the help of [usvsth3m games](http://usvsth3m.com/)) made a few fun variants:
 +   [Seattle](http://games.usvsth3m.com/2048/seattle-edition/)
 +   [Mushrooms](http://games.usvsth3m.com/2048/mushroom-edition-11/)
 +   [DNA](http://games.usvsth3m.com/2048/DNA-edition/)
 +   [Jinkx Monsoon](http://games.usvsth3m.com/2048/jinkx-monsoon-edition-2/)
