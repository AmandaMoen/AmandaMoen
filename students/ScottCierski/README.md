### Python & Me
The first Python program I wrote was an eBay web scraper for my job in 2000. A few years later I wrote my first Python game (using the Pygame library) which featured pictures of my friends' faces vomiting, because I am a mature adult.

Since then I've written bits of Python here and there but never really had a good foundation or reason to regularly develop in it, so I joined this class. Hooray!

### Databases & Me
Much of my career has been spent managing databases for boring and/or stupid companies. A few years back I decided to enter the games industry, so things are a bit more fun now. Currently I work for Gazillion Entertainment, mainly on our newest game [Marvel Heroes](http://marvelheroes.com/ "Marvel Heroes").

### Games & Me
I've been playing video games since I was a kid 200 years ago, and I've been developing games in some form or another since the late 90s. Like 70% of the people in Seattle, last year I started my own small game company. Hopefully we'll ship our first game sometime before we all die.

### You & Me
I know we've only just met, but for some reason I feel comfortable saying this: I love you.
