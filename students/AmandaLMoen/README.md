## A bit about me
28 years old, grew up in Lake Stevens, Washington. Graduated high school in 2004.  Spend the next several years attending Everett Community College.  First 3 years I majored in Accounting, then I changed my major to elementary education.  Mostly, I was staying a full-time college student in order to maintain my health insurance through my mother's work.  (I would have loved to have taken a quarter off to figure things out.) Fall 2008, I decided to change my major to Computer Information Systems.  My reasoning behind that was along the lines of "When it comes to computers I know more than some, but less than others." So, I decided I want to learn more. the pay doesn't hurt, either.

## Programming Background
Part of my Computer Informations Systems program of study consisted of a few programming classes. I took a class called CS110: Introduction to Programming, which was a class on Python, and I took CS131: Computer Science I, which was a class on C++.  I really liked the detail and structured form that these two languages required, at least for good, readable code.

At the beginning of this year I took a Girl Develop It Intro to Python course, mostly, to refresh my memory of Python and brush up on my Python.

### Personal Idiosyncrasies
I have ADD, Sensory Integration (or sensory processing disorder).  Since 2007 I have been suffering with premature ovarian failure.  I am the one single gal at my fertility support group.  When I am bored I do math.

## What I Like
I like dogs, cats, and horses. I love to read and drive. I'd rather drive a vehicle with a manual transmission over an automatic. Taking ballet classes. And a ton more stuff. I like fish, but not shellfish.
