## I am: 		

A recent graduate from the Physics and Philosophy departments at University of Oregon. I spent the last year working in various roles in the aerospace industry. I did everything from operating a CNC laser, to programming data collection systems in MS Excel and Access.

One of the things I like to do is go mountain biking. If you'd like to watch some cool mountain biking videos, which everyone should, go check out:

I also enjoy slack lining, rock climbing, brewing, reading, writing, and learnin' stuff.
