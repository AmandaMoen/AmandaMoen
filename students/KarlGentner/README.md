## About Me:

My name is Karl Gentner. I am currently a stay-at-home dad looking to get back to work as my daughter transitions to full-time preschool. Prior to fatherhood, I had devoted my life to all things related to audio... including some absolutely awful bands. Thankfully my daughter doesn't even know what a Compact Disc is. 


Now, I'm excited to try something new with programming. I have some previous experience using MATLAB and Java. More recently, I have taken Code Fellows Foundations I and Code Fellows II Javascript courses which have focused more on front-end web development.I'm looking forward to learning a little more about back-end development with Python. If all goes well, I hope to attend a Code Fellows bootcamp in the future.
