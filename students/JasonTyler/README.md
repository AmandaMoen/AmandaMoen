## Jason Tyler

### Education
Studied Chemistry in college, had a taste of grad school, spent most of my time throughout building stuff in laser labs. 

### Work
Worked for the company that supports the ORCA card project. Had a two year stint repairing ORCA card machines and then doing high level sales support work. Currently in a transitional period.

### Programming
Have the standard "lab rat pack" of software skills. Wrote I/O and data-analysis programs in LabView to power projects. Was introduced to Python through a Coursera course, and have since spent time trying to familiarize myself with what it can do.

### Other bits
Spend my time trying to play idiomatic Irish/Scottish fiddle and occasionally making sculptures.
