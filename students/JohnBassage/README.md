#### Background
I grew up in Vermont. That's one of those places where [they say soda instead of pop.](http://www.popvssoda.com/) Now I live in Ballard and work as a private investigator. 

#### Foreground
I'm taking this course now and hoping to follow it up with the bigger course next month, with the hope of eventually mastering a new skill. My current job is pretty fun, but I think it'd be pretty cool to have a talent for creating something instead of just Facebook stalking.
