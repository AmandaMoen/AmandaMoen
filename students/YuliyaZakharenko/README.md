####Work
- I am a SQL developer/Data Analyst working for [Lifelong AIDS Alliance] [2]
- I love writing SQL queries.
- I have taken JavaScript Foundation II class at Code Fellows and really enjoyed it. 
- I am using JavaScript at work to customize Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
- I am new to Python and am really excited to try it out. 
####Personal
- Here is [web site] [1] I built for my sister-in-law. It is very minimalistic. Becuase I like it that way...and because my web site development skills are quiet rusty. 
- I want to learn Japanese and find a job that allows me to travel.
