About Me
---------

### A Bit of Background 

I am a recent MBA graduate from the University of Michigan. After completing my MBA, I returned to Seattle to work on projects for [*eSage Group*][5], a systems integration 
and analytics consultancy. At *eSage Group*, I became intrigued by big data as I witnessed the task companies face in harnessing vast amounts of data and deriving actionable insights from it. Before attending the University of Michigan, I worked as a product manager for *Scientific Explorer* and *Elmer's Products*, developing 
[children's educational activity kits][6].

### Goals for Learning Python

This fall I will begin the University of Washington's Data Science Certificate program so my goal is to accelerate learning Python to move into a role as a web developer and ultimately a data scientist.

+ Specific Goals for This Course
    - Develop fundamental skills in Python
    - Become unafraid of breaking stuff
    - Meet new people

### Previous Programming Experience 

I have been learning some Python independently as well as HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. To gain more experience with front end development, I'm building a website on color analysis. I love languages, analytics, design and detail. I feel there's almost something magical about programming; having the freedom to build anything is my main 
underlying motivation.
