### Who am I?
I hold undergraduate degrees in Astronomy and Physics from the University of Texas.  There I was exposed to the wonderful world of scientific programming, mostly in [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and [IDL](http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx).  I have also learned the basics of Python, R, and XML.  I currently manage data using SQL, but the work is very repetitive.  I'd like to learn to be a developer for a more challenging and rewarding career.
