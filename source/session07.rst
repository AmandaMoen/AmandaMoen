More on Subclassing
===================

Watch This Video:

http://pyvideo.org/video/879/the-art-of-subclassing

.. rst-class:: left

Seriously, well worth the time.

What's a Subclass For?
----------------------

The most salient points from that video are as follows:

**Subclassing is not for Specialization**

**Subclassing is for Reusing Code**

**Bear in mind that the subclass is in charge**


Multiple Inheritance
--------------------

Multiple inheritance: Inheriting from more than one class

Simply provide more than one parent.

.. code-block:: python

    class Combined(Super1, Super2, Super3):
        def __init__(self, something, something else):
            # some custom initialization here.
            Super1.__init__(self, ......)
            Super2.__init__(self, ......)
            Super3.__init__(self, ......)
            # possibly more custom initialization


(calls to the super class ``__init__``  are optional -- case dependent)

.. nextslide:: Method Resolution Order

.. code-block:: python

    class Combined(Super1, Super2, Super3)

Attributes are located bottom-to-top, left-to-right

* Is it an instance attribute ?
* Is it a class attribute ?
* Is it a superclass attribute ?

  * is the it an attribute of the left-most superclass?
  * is the it an attribute of the next superclass?
  * and so on up the hierarchy...

* Is it a super-superclass attribute ?
* ... also left to right ...

http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/method-resolution-order.html

.. nextslide:: Mix-ins

Provides an subset of expected functionality in a re-usable package.

Why would you want to do this?

Hierarchies are not always simple:

* Animal

  * Mammal

    * GiveBirth()
    
  * Bird
    
    * LayEggs()
    
Where do you put a Platypus?

Real World Example: `FloatCanvas`_

.. _FloatCanvas: https://github.com/svn2github/wxPython/blob/master/3rdParty/FloatCanvas/floatcanvas/FloatCanvas.py#L485

**Careful About This Pattern**


.. nextslide:: New-Style Classes

All the class definitions we've been showing inherit from ``object``.

This is referred to as a "new style" class.

They were introduced in python2.2 to better merge types and classes, and clean
up a few things.

There are differences in method resolution order and properties.

**Always Make New-Style Classes.**

The differences are subtle, and may not appear until they jump up to bite you.


.. nextslide:: ``super()``

``super()``: use it to call a superclass method, rather than explicitly calling
the unbound method on the superclass.

instead of:

.. code-block:: python  

    class A(B):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
            B.__init__(self, *argw, **kwargs)
            ...

You can do:

.. code-block:: python  

    class A(B):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
            super(A, self).__init__(self, *argw, **kwargs)
            ...

.. nextslide:: Caveats

Caution: There are some subtle differences with multiple inheritance.

You can use explicit calling to ensure that the 'right' method is called.


.. nextslide:: Background

Two seminal articles about ``super()``:

"Super Considered Harmful" -- James Knight

https://fuhm.net/super-harmful/

"super() considered super!"  --  Raymond Hettinger

http://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/}

(Both worth reading....)


Properties
==========

.. rst-class:: left
.. container::

    One of the strengths of Python is lack of clutter.

    Attributes are simple and concise:

    .. code-block:: ipython

        In [5]: class C(object):
                def __init__(self):
                        self.x = 5
        In [6]: c = C()
        In [7]: c.x
        Out[7]: 5
        In [8]: c.x = 8
        In [9]: c.x
        Out[9]: 8


Getter and Setters?
-------------------

But what if you need to add behavior later?

.. rst-class:: build

* do some calculation
* check data validity
* keep things in sync


.. nextslide::

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [5]: class C(object):
       ...:     def __init__(self):
       ...:         self.x = 5
       ...:     def get_x(self):
       ...:         return self.x
       ...:     def set_x(self, x):
       ...:         self.x = x
       ...:
    In [6]: c = C()
    In [7]: c.get_x()
    Out[7]: 5
    In [8]: c.set_x(8)
    In [9]: c.get_x()
    Out[9]: 8


<shudder> This is ugly and verbose -- `Java`_?

.. _Java: http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html

.. nextslide:: properties

When (and if) you need them:

.. code-block:: python

    class C(object):
        def __init__(self, x=5):
            self._x = x
        def _getx(self):
            return self._x
        def _setx(self, value):
            self._x = value
        def _delx(self):
            del self._x
        x = property(_getx, _setx, _delx, doc="docstring")

Now the interface is still like simple attribute access!

.. rst-class:: centered small

[demo: :download:`properties_example.py <./supplements/properties_example.py>`]


.. nextslide:: "Read Only" Attributes

Not all the arguments to ``property`` are required.

You can use this to create attributes that are "read only":

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [11]: class D(object):
       ....:     def __init__(self, x=5):
       ....:         self._x = 5
       ....:     def getx(self):
       ....:         return self._x
       ....:     x = property(getx, doc="I am read only")
       ....:
    In [12]: d = D()
    In [13]: d.x
    Out[13]: 5
    In [14]: d.x = 6
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-14-c83386d97be3> in <module>()
    ----> 1 d.x = 6
    AttributeError: can't set attribute


.. nextslide:: Syntactic Sugar

This *imperative* style of adding a ``property`` to you class is clear, but
it's still a little verbose.

It also has the effect of leaving all those defined method objects laying
around:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [19]: d.x
    Out[19]: 5
    In [20]: d.getx
    Out[20]: <bound method D.getx of <__main__.D object at 0x1043a4a10>>
    In [21]: d.getx()
    Out[21]: 5

.. nextslide::

Python provides us with a way to solve both these issues at once, using a
syntactic feature called **decorators** (more about these next session):

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [22]: class E(object):
       ....:     def __init__(self, x=5):
       ....:         self._x = x
       ....:     @property
       ....:     def x(self):
       ....:         return self._x
       ....:     @x.setter
       ....:     def x(self, value):
       ....:         self._x = value
       ....:
    In [23]: e = E()
    In [24]: e.x
    Out[24]: 5
    In [25]: e.x = 6
    In [26]: e.x
    Out[26]: 6


Static and Class Methods
========================

.. rst-class:: left build
.. container::

    You've seen how methods of a class are *bound* to an instance when it is
    created.

    And you've seen how the argument ``self`` is then automatically passed to
    the method when it is called.

    And you've seen how you can call *unbound* methods on a class object so
    long as you pass an instance of that class as the first argument.

    .. rst-class:: centered

    **But what if you don't want or need an instance?**


Static Methods
--------------

A *static method* is a method that doesn't get self:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [36]: class StaticAdder(object):
       ....:     def add(a, b):
       ....:         return a + b
       ....:     add = staticmethod(add)
       ....:

    In [37]: StaticAdder.add(3, 6)
    Out[37]: 9

.. rst-class:: centered

[demo: :download:`static_method.py <./supplements/static_method.py>`]


.. nextslide:: Syntactic Sugar

Like ``properties``, static methods can be written *declaratively* using the
``staticmethod`` built-in as a *decorator*:

.. code-block:: python

    class StaticAdder(object):
        @staticmethod
        def add(a, b):
            return a + b

.. nextslide:: Why?

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    Where are static methods useful?

    Usually they aren't

    99% of the time, it's better just to write a module-level function

    An example from the Standard Library (tarfile.py):

    .. code-block:: python
        
        class TarInfo(object):
            # ...
            @staticmethod
            def _create_payload(payload):
                """Return the string payload filled with zero bytes
                   up to the next 512 byte border.
                """
                blocks, remainder = divmod(len(payload), BLOCKSIZE)
                if remainder > 0:
                    payload += (BLOCKSIZE - remainder) * NUL
                return payload


Class Methods
-------------

A class method gets the class object, rather than an instance, as the first
argument

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [41]: class Classy(object):
       ....:     x = 2
       ....:     def a_class_method(cls, y):
       ....:         print "in a class method: ", cls
       ....:         return y ** cls.x
       ....:     a_class_method = classmethod(a_class_method)
       ....:
    In [42]: Classy.a_class_method(4)
    in a class method:  <class '__main__.Classy'>
    Out[42]: 16

.. rst-class:: centered

[demo: :download:`class_method.py <./supplements/class_method.py>`]

.. nextslide:: Syntactic Sugar

Once again, the ``classmethod`` built-in can be used as a *decorator* for a
more declarative style of programming:

.. code-block:: python

    class Classy(object):
        x = 2
        @classmethod
        def a_class_method(cls, y):
            print "in a class method: ", cls
            return y ** cls.x

.. nextslide:: Why?

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    Unlike static methods, class methods are quite common.

    They have the advantage of being friendly to subclassing.

    Consider this:

    .. code-block:: ipython
    
        In [44]: class SubClassy(Classy):
           ....:     x = 3
           ....:

        In [45]: SubClassy.a_class_method(4)
        in a class method:  <class '__main__.SubClassy'>
        Out[45]: 64

.. nextslide:: Alternate Constructors

Because of this friendliness to subclassing, class methods are often used to
build alternate constructors.

Consider the case of wanting to build a dictionary with a given iterable of
keys:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [57]: d = dict([1,2,3])
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-57-50c56a77d95f> in <module>()
    ----> 1 d = dict([1,2,3])

    TypeError: cannot convert dictionary update sequence element #0 to a sequence


.. nextslide:: ``dict.fromkeys()``

The stock constructor for a dictionary won't work this way. So the dict object
implements an alternate constructor that *can*.

.. code-block:: python

    @classmethod
    def fromkeys(cls, iterable, value=None):
        '''OD.fromkeys(S[, v]) -> New ordered dictionary with keys from S.
        If not specified, the value defaults to None.

        '''
        self = cls()
        for key in iterable:
            self[key] = value
        return self

(this is actually from the OrderedDict implementation in ``collections.py``)

See also datetime.datetime.now(), etc....

.. nextslide:: Curious?

Properties, Static Methods and Class Methods are powerful features of Pythons
OO model.

They are implemented using an underlying structure called *descriptors*

`Here is a low level look`_ at how the descriptor protocol works.

The cool part is that this mechanism is available to you, the programmer, as
well.

.. _Here is a low level look: https://docs.python.org/2/howto/descriptor.html


Kicking the Tires
-----------------

Let's pause for a moment here to try some of this out.

Write a simple "Circle" class that will behave thusly:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [13]: c = Circle(3)
    In [15]: c.diameter
    Out[15]: 6.0
    In [16]: c.diameter = 8
    In [17]: c.radius
    Out[17]: 4.0
    In [18]: c.area
    Out[18]: 50.26548245743669


Use ``properties`` so you can keep the radius and diameter in sync, and the
area computed on the fly.

Extra Credit: use a class method to make an alternate constructor that takes
the diameter instead.


Special Methods
===============

.. rst-class:: left
.. container::

    Special methods (also called *magic* methods) are the secret sauce to Python's
    Duck typing.

    Defining the appropriate special methods in your classes is how you make your
    class act like standard classes.

What's in a Name?
-----------------

We've seen at least one special method so far::

    __init__

It's all in the double underscores...

Pronounced "dunder" (or "under-under")

try: ``dir(2)``  or ``dir(list)``

.. nextslide:: Protocols

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    The set of special methods needed to emulate a particular type of Python object
    is called a *protocol*.

    Your classes can "become" like Python built-in classes by implementing the
    methods in a given protocol.

    Remember, these are more *guidelines* than laws.  Implement what you need.


.. nextslide:: The Numerics Protocol

Do you want your class to behave like a number? Implement these methods:

.. code-block:: python

    object.__add__(self, other)
    object.__sub__(self, other)
    object.__mul__(self, other)
    object.__floordiv__(self, other)
    object.__mod__(self, other)
    object.__divmod__(self, other)
    object.__pow__(self, other[, modulo])
    object.__lshift__(self, other)
    object.__rshift__(self, other)
    object.__and__(self, other)
    object.__xor__(self, other)
    object.__or__(self, other)

.. nextslide:: The Container Protocol

Want to make a container type? Here's what you need:

.. code-block:: python

    object.__len__(self)
    object.__getitem__(self, key)
    object.__setitem__(self, key, value)
    object.__delitem__(self, key)
    object.__iter__(self)
    object.__reversed__(self)
    object.__contains__(self, item)
    object.__getslice__(self, i, j)
    object.__setslice__(self, i, j, sequence)
    object.__delslice__(self, i, j)


.. nextslide:: An Example

Each of these methods supports a common Python operation.

For example, to make '+' work with a sequence type in a vector-like fashion, implement ``__add__``:

.. code-block:: python

    def __add__(self, v):
        """return the element-wise vector sum of self and v
        """
        assert len(self) == len(v)
        return vector([x1 + x2 for x1, x2 in zip(self, v)])

.. rst-class:: centered

[a more complete example may be seen :download:`here <./supplements/vector.py>`]


.. nextslide:: Generally Useful Special Methods

You only *need* to define the special methods that will be used by your class.

However, even in the absence of wanting to duck-type, you should almost always
define these:

``object.__str__``:
  Called by the str() built-in function and by the print statement to compute
  the *informal* string representation of an object.

``object.__unicode__``:
  Called by the unicode() built-in function.  This converts an object to an
  *informal* unicode representation.

``object.__repr__``:
  Called by the repr() built-in function and by string conversions (reverse
  quotes) to compute the *official* string representation of an object.

  (ideally: ``eval( repr(something) ) == something``)

.. nextslide:: Summary

Use special methods when you want your class to act like a "standard" class in
some way.

Look up the special methods you need and define them.

There's more to read about the details of implementing these methods:

* https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names
* http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html

Be a bit cautious about the code examples in that last one. It uses quite a bit
of old-style class definitions, which should not be emulated.


Kicking the Tires
-----------------

Extend your "Circle" class:

* Add ``__str__``  and ``__repr__``  methods
* Write an ``__add__``  method so you can add two circles
* Make it so you can multiply a circle by a number....

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [22]: c1 = Circle(3)
    In [23]: c2 = Circle(4)
    In [24]: c3 = c1+c2
    In [25]: c3.radius
    Out[25]: 7
    In [26]: c1*3
    Out[26]: Circle(9)

If you have time: compare them... (``c1 > c2`` , etc)


Homework
========

Create a Python module that emulates a deck of playing cards.

Your deck of cards should behave like a standard Python container.

It should also support the iterator protocol.

You should be able to shuffle the deck, resulting in a random ordering of the
cards.

You should also be able to sort the deck so that the cards are ordered by suit
and face value.
