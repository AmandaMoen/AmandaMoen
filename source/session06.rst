Object Oriented Programming
===========================

Object Oriented Programming
---------------------------

More about Python implementation than OO design/strengths/weaknesses

One reason for this:

Folks can't even agree on what OO "really" means

See: The Quarks of Object-Oriented Development - Deborah J. Armstrong:

http://agp.hx0.ru/oop/quarks.pdf

.. nextslide::

Is Python a "True" Object-Oriented Language?

(Doesn't support full encapsulation, doesn't require
objects, etc...)

.. nextslide::

I don't Care!

Good software design is about code re-use, clean separation of concerns,
refactorability, testability, etc...

OO can help with all that, but:
  * It doesn't guarantee it
  * It can get in the way

.. nextslide::


Python is a Dynamic Language}

That clashes with "pure" OO}

Think in terms of what makes sense for your project
 -- not any one paradigm of software design.


.. nextslide::


"Objects can be thought of as wrapping their data 
within a set of functions designed to ensure that 
the data are used appropriately, and to assist in 
that use"


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming}

.. nextslide::

Even simpler:


Objects are data and the functions that act on them in one place.

This is the core of "encapsulation"

In Python: just another namespace.

.. nextslide::

The OO buzzwords:

  * data abstraction
  * encapsulation
  * modularity
  * polymorphism
  * inheritance

Python does all of this, though it doesn't enforce it.

.. nextslide::

You can do OO in C

(see the GTK+ project)


"OO languages" give you some handy tools to make it easier (and safer):

  * polymorphism (duck typing gives you this anyway)
  * inheritance


Object Oriented Programming

.. nextslide::

OO is the dominant model for the past couple decades

You will need to use it:

- It's a good idea for a lot of problems

- You'll need to work with OO packages

(Even a fair bit of the standard library is Object Oriented)


.. nextslide::

Some definitions:

class
  A category of objects: particular data and behavior: A "circle" (same as a type in python)

instance
  A particular object of a class: a specific circle

object
  The general case of a instance -- really any value (in Python anyway)

attribute
  Something that belongs to an object (or class)
    - generally thought of as a variable, or single object, as opposed to a ...

method
  A function that belongs to a class

(Note that in python, functions are first class objects, to a method *is* an attribute)


==============
Python Classes
==============

Python Classes
--------------

The ``class``  statement

``class``  creates a new type object:

.. code-block:: ipython 

    In [4]: class C(object):
        pass
       ...:
    In [5]: type(C)
    Out[5]: type

A class is a type -- interesting!

It is created when the statement is run -- much like ``def``

You don't *have* to subclass from ``object``, but you *should* 

(note on "new style" classes)

.. nextslide::

About the simplest class you can write

.. code-block:: python

    >>> class Point(object):
    ...     x = 1
    ...     y = 2
    >>> Point
    <class __main__.Point at 0x2bf928>
    >>> Point.x
    1
    >>> p = Point()
    >>> p
    <__main__.Point instance at 0x2de918>
    >>> p.x
    1

.. nextslide::

Basic Structure of a real class:

.. code-block:: python
    
    class Point(object):
    # everything defined in here is in the class namespace

        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

    ## create an instance of the class
    p = Point(3,4)

    ## access the attributes
    print "p.x is:", p.x
    print "p.y is:", p.y


see: ``code/simple_class``

.. nextslide::

The Initializer

The ``__init__``  special method is called when a new instance of a class is created.

You can use it to do any set-up you need

.. code-block:: python  

    class Point(object):
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y


It gets the arguments passed when you call the class object:

.. code-block:: python  

    Point(x, y)

.. nextslide::


What is this ``self`` thing?

The instance of the class is passed as the first parameter for every method.

"``self``" is only a convention -- but you DO want to use it.

.. code-block:: python  
    
    class Point(object):
        def a_function(self, x, y):
    ...


Does this look familiar from C-style procedural programming?

.. code-block:: python

    class Point(object):
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y


Anything assigned to a ``self.``  attribute is kept in the instance
name space -- ``self`` *is* the instance.

That's where all the instance-specific data is.


.. code-block:: python  

    class Point(object):
        size = 4
        color= "red"
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y


Anything assigned in the class scope is a class attribute -- every
instance of the class shares the same one.

Note: the methods defined by ``def`` are class attributes as well.

The class is one namespace, the instance is another.

.. nextslide::

.. code-block:: python  

    class Point(object):
        size = 4
        color= "red"
    ...
        def get_color():
            return self.color
    >>> p3.get_color()
     'red'


class attributes are accessed with ``self``  also.


.. nextslide::

Typical methods:

.. code-block:: python  

    class Circle(object):
        color = "red"

        def __init__(self, diameter):
            self.diameter = diameter

        def grow(self, factor=2):
            self.diameter = self.diameter * factor


Methods take some parameters, manipulate the attributes in ``self``.

They may or may not return something useful.

.. nextslide::

Gotcha!

.. code-block:: python  

    ...
        def grow(self, factor=2):
            self.diameter = self.diameter * factor
    ...
    In [205]: C = Circle(5)
    In [206]: C.grow(2,3)

    TypeError: grow() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)

Huh???? I only gave 2}

``self`` is implicitly passed in for you by python.

LAB / homework
---------------

Let's say you need to render some html..

The goal is to build a set of classes that render an html page:

``code/session06/sample_html.html`` 

We'll start with a single class, then add some sub-classes to specialize the behavior

More details in ``code/session06/LAB_instuctions.rst`` 

.. nextslide::

Step 1:

* Create an "Element" class for rendering an html element (xml element).
* It should have class attributes for the tag name  and the
  indentation
* the constructor signature should look like:
    ``Element(content=None)``  where content is a string
* It should have an "append" method that can add another string to the content
* It should have a ``render(file_out, ind = "")``  method that renders the tag and the strings in the content.
     ``file_out``  could be any file-like object.
     ``ind``  is a string with enough spaces to indent properly.


=======================
Subclassing/Inheritance
=======================

Inheritance
-----------

In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a way to reuse code of existing objects, or to establish a subtype from an existing object.


Objects are defined by classes, classes can inherit attributes and behavior from pre-existing classes called base classes or super classes.

The resulting classes are known as derived classes or subclasses.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29})

Subclassing
-----------

A subclass "inherits" all the attributes (methods, etc) of the parent class.

You can then change ("override") some or all of the attributes to change the behavior.

You can also add new attributes to extend the behavior.

The simplest subclass in Python:

.. code-block:: python 

    class A_Subclass(The_SuperClass):
        pass

``A_subclass``  now has exactly the same behavior as ``The_SuperClass`` 

NOTE: when we put ``object`` in there, it means we are deriving from object -- getting core functionality of all objects.

Overriding attributes
---------------------

Overriding is as simple as creating a new attribute with the same name:

.. code-block:: python     

    class Circle(object):
        color = "red"

    ...

    class NewCircle(Circle):
        color = "blue"
    >>> nc = NewCircle
    >>> print nc.color
    blue


all the ``self``  instances will have the new attribute.

Overriding methods
------------------

Same thing, but with methods (remember, a method *is* an attribute in python)

.. code-block:: python 

    class Circle(object):

    ...

        def grow(self, factor=2):
            """grows the circle's diameter by factor"""
            self.diameter = self.diameter * factor

    ...

    class NewCircle(Circle):

    ...

        def grow(self, factor=2):
            """grows the area by factor..."""
            self.diameter = self.diameter * math.sqrt(2)


all the instances will have the new method

.. nextslide::

Here's a program design suggestion: whenever you override a method, the
interface of the new method should be the same as the old.  It should take
the same parameters, return the same type, and obey the same preconditions
and postconditions.  If you obey this rule, you will find that any function
designed to work with an instance of a superclass, like a Deck, will also work
with instances of subclasses like a Hand or PokerHand.  If you violate this
rule, your code will collapse like (sorry) a house of cards.

[ThinkPython 18.10]

LAB / Homework
---------------

Step 2:

*  Create a couple subclasses of ``Element`` , for a ``<body>``  tag and ``<p>``  tag. Simply override the ``tag``  class attribute.
* Extend the ``Element.render()``  method so that it can render other elements inside the tag in addition to strings. Simple recursion should do it. i.e. it can call the ``render()``  method of the elements it contains.
* Deal with the content items that could be either simple strings or ``Element`` s with ``render``  methods ... there are a few ways to handle that.

.. nextslide::

Step 3:

* Create a ``<head>``  element -- simple subclass.
* Create a ``OneLineTag``  subclass of Element: It should override the render method, to render everything on one line -- for the simple tags, like:

        ``<title> PythonClass - Class 6 example </title>`` 

* Create a Title subclass of ``OneLineTag``  class for the title.
* You should now be able to render an html doc with a head element, with a ``title``  element in that, and a body element with some ``<P>`` elements and some text.

Demo of class vs. instance attributes

===================
More on Subclassing
===================

Overriding \_\_init\_\_
-----------------------
``__init__`` common method to override}

You often need to call the super class ``__init__``  as well}

::
    

    class Circle(object):
        color = "red"
        def __init__(self, diameter):
            self.diameter = diameter
    ...
    class CircleR(Circle):
        def __init__(self, radius):
            diameter = radius*2
            Circle.__init__(self, diameter)



exception to: "don't change the method signature" rule.

More subclassing
----------------
You can also call the superclass' other methods:}

::
    

    class Circle(object):
    ...
        def get_area(self, diameter):
            return math.pi * (diameter/2.0)**2
    class CircleR2(Circle):
    ...
        def get_area(self):
            return Circle.get_area(self, self.radius*2)



There is nothing special about ``__init__``  except that it gets called automatically.

When to Subclass
----------------

"Is a" relationship: Subclass/inheritance}

"Has a" relationship: Composition}

When to Subclass
----------------
"Is a" vs "Has a" }

You may have a class that needs to accumulate an arbitrary number of objects.

A list can do that -- so should you subclass list?

Ask yourself:

-- Is your class a list (with some extra functionality)?
or
-- Does you class HAVE a list?

You only want to subclass list if your class could be used anywhere a list can be used.

Attribute resolution order
--------------------------
When you access an attribute:

``An_Instance.something`` }

Python looks for it in this order:}


  * Is it an instance attribute ?
  * Is it a class attribute ?
  * Is it a superclass attribute ?
  * Is it a super-superclass attribute ?
  * ...


It can get more complicated...

}

What are Python classes, really?
--------------------------------
Putting aside the OO theory...}

Python classes are:}

  * Namespaces
  
    * One for the class object
    * One for each instance
  
  * Attribute resolution order
  * Auto tacking-on of ``self`` 


That's about it -- really!}

Type-Based dispatch
-------------------
From Think Python:}
::
    

      if isinstance(other, A_Class):
          Do_something_with_other
      else:
          Do_something_else



Usually better to use "duck typing" (polymorphism)}

But when it's called for:}

    * ``isinstance()`` 
    * ``issubclass()``

We're going to do the rest: steps 4 - 8}

(Still using ``week-06/code/htmlrender`` )

Step 4:

* Extend the Element class to accept a set of attributes as keywords to the
  constructor, i.e.:

.. code-block:: python  

  Element("some text content",
          id="TheList",
          style="line-height:200\%")


( remember ``**kwargs``  ? )

* The render method will need to be extended to render the attributes properly.


You can now render some ``<p>``  tags (and others) with attributes

.. nextslide::

Step 5:

* Create a ``SelfClosingTag``  subclass of ``Element`` , to render tags like: ``<hr /> and <br />``  (horizontal rule and line break).
* You will need to override the render method to render just the one tag and attributes.
* create a couple subclasses of SelfClosingTag for ``<hr>`` and ``<br />``  (Line break) or ??? if you like
   
You can now render an html page with a proper ``<head>``  (``<meta />``  and ``<title>``  elements)

.. nextslide::

*  Create an ``A``  class for an anchor (link) element. Its constructor should look like: ``A(self, link, content)``  -- where link is the link, and content is what you see. It can be called like so: ``A("http://google.com", "link")`` 
* You should be able to subclass from ``Element`` , and only override the ``__init__`` -- Calling the ``Element __init__``  from the  ``A __init__`` 


You can now add a link to your web page.

Step 7:

* Create ``Ul``  class for an unordered list (really simple subclass of Element)
* Create ``Li``  class for an element in a list (also really simple)
* add a list to your web page.
* Create a Header class -- this one should take an integer argument for the header level. i.e ``<h1>, <h2>, <h3>`` , called like:
* ``H(2, "The text of the header")``  for an ``<h2>``  header
* It can subclass from ``OneLineTag``  -- overriding the ``__init__`` , then callingthe superclass ``__init__`` 


Step 8:

* Update the Html element class to render the "``<!DOCTYPE html>`` " tag at the head of the page, before the ``html``  element.
* You can do this by subclassing ``Element`` , overriding ``render()`` , but then calling ``Element.render()``  from ``Html.render()`` .
* Create a subclass of ``SelfClosingTag``  for ``<meta charset="UTF-8" />``  and add the meta element to the beginning of the head element to give your document an encoding.
* The doctype and encoding are HTML 5 and you can check this at: validator.w3.org.


You now have a pretty full-featured html renderer

Review of HTML renderer lab
---------------------------
You have built an html generator, using:}
  
* A Base Class with a couple methods
* Subclasses overriding class attributes
* Subclasses overriding a method
* Subclasses overriding the ``__init__`` 
  

These are the core OO approaches

If you don't have it working, or don't think you "get" it: work on it for homework, and ask questions.

    class CircleR2(Circle):
    ...
        def get_area(self):

Attribute resolution -- left to right}

* Is it an instance attribute ?
* Is it a class attribute ?
* Is it a superclass attribute ?
  
   - is the it an attribute of the left-most superclass?

   -  and so on up the hierarchy...
  
* Is it a super-superclass attribute ?
* ... also left to right ...

Mix-ins

Why would you want to do this?}

Hierarchies are not always simple:

* Animal

  * Mammal

    * GiveBirth()
    
  * Bird
    
    * LayEggs()
    
Where do you put a Platypus?

Real World Example: ``FloatCanvas``

New Style classes
-----------------

You will see reference to "new style" classes

These derive from ``object`` 

Introduced in python2.2 to better merge types and classes, and clean up a few things.

Differences in method resolution order and properties.

Mostly the same, often makes no difference.

My advice: always subclass from ``object``.

super
-----

``super()``: use it to call a superclass method, rather than explicitly calling it.

instead of:

.. code-block:: python  

    class A(B):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
            B.__init__(self, *argw, **kwargs)
            ...

You can do:

.. code-block:: python  

    class A(B):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
            super(A, self).__init__(self, *argw, **kwargs)
            ...

Caution: There are some subtle differences with multiple inheritance.

.. nextslide::

Two seminal articles about ``super()``:

"Super Considered Harmful" -- James Knight

https://fuhm.net/super-harmful/

"super() considered super!"  --  Raymond Hettinger

http://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/}

(Both worth reading....)

Wrap Up

Thinking OO in Python:

Think about what makes sense for your code:

* Code re-use
