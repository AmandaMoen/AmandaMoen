    Python spelling of things you know from foundations 1
    * basic data types (string, list/tuple (arrays), dict (mapping/object))
    * basic function calling
    * basic logic flow (for/while/if)
    * boatload of exercises (4-6 hours of expected work) in practicing the
      Python spellings of these things.
