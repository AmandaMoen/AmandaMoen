*********************
Foundations 2: Python
*********************

This repository houses presentations and class materials for the Code Fellows
Foundations 2 course in Python programming.

The documentation is written in `ReStructuredText`_ and output formats are
included for html, epub and `html5slides`_ (via the excellent `hieroglyph`_
package).

.. _ReStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
.. _html5slides: https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/
.. _hieroglyph: http://docs.hieroglyph.io/en/latest/index.html


Building The Documents
======================

To build this documentation, begin by cloning the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/cewing/codefellows_f2_python.git
    ...
    $ cd codefellows_f2_python

To isolate the packages required from your system Python, create a
`virtualenv`_. I highly recommend using `virtualenvwrapper`_ to manage your
virtual environmants:

.. _virtualenv: http://virtualenv.org
.. _virtualenvwrapper: http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkvirtualenv codefellows_f2_python
    New python executable in codefellows_f2_python/bin/python
    Installing setuptools, pip...done.
    [codefellows_f2_python]$

Once that is complete, you can install all the required packages with `pip`_:

.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org

.. code-block:: bash

    [codefellows_f2_python]$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Finally, build the documentation using one of the output targets. To build the
plain html version, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    [codefellows_f2_python]$ make htmlmake html
    sphinx-build -b html -d build/doctrees   source build/html
    Running Sphinx v1.2.2
    ...
    build succeeded.

    Build finished. The HTML pages are in build/html.
    [codefellows_f2_python]$

Or the html5 slides:

.. code-block:: bash

    [codefellows_f2_python]$ make slides
    sphinx-build -b slides -d build/doctrees   source build/slides
    Running Sphinx v1.2.2
    ...
    Build finished. The HTML slides are in build/slides.

Or the epub documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

    [codefellows_f2_python]$ make epub
    sphinx-build -b epub -d build/doctrees   source build/epub
    Running Sphinx v1.2.2
    ...
    Build finished. The epub file is in build/epub.
