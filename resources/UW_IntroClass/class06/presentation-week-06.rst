  Homework Questions? 
  

======
Lambda
======

lambda
======
"Anonymous" functions

::
    

    In [171]: f = lambda x, y: x+y
    In [172]: f(2,3)
    Out[172]: 5



Can only be an expression -- not a statement

lambda
======
Called "Anonymous": it doesn't need a name.

It's a python object, it can be stored in a list or other container

::
    

    In [7]: l = [lambda x, y: x+y]
    In [8]: type(l[0])
    Out[8]: function



And you can call it:

::
    

    In [9]: l[0](3,4)
    Out[9]: 7



functions as first class objects
================================
You can do that with "regular" functions too:

::
    

    In [12]: def fun(x,y):
       ....:     return x+y
       ....:
    In [13]: l = [fun]
    In [14]: type(l[0])
    Out[14]: function
    In [15]: l[0](3,4)
    Out[15]: 7



======================
Functional Programming
======================

map
===
``map``  "maps" a function onto a sequence of objects --
It applies the function to each item in the list, returning another list
::
    

    In [23]: l = [2, 5, 7, 12, 6, 4]
    In [24]: def fun(x):
                 return x*2 + 10
    In [25]: map(fun, l)
    Out[25]: [14, 20, 24, 34, 22, 18]


But if you only need that function once:
::
    

    In [26]: map(lambda x: x*2 + 10, l)
    Out[26]: [14, 20, 24, 34, 22, 18]



filter
======
``filter``  "filters" a sequence of objects with a boolean function --
It keeps only those for which the function is True


To get only the even numbers
::
    

    In [27]: l = [2, 5, 7, 12, 6, 4]
    In [28]: filter(lambda x: not x%2, l)
    Out[28]: [2, 12, 6, 4]



reduce
======
``reduce``  "reduces" a sequence of objects to a single object with a function that combines two arguments

To get the sum:
::
    

    In [30]: l = [2, 5, 7, 12, 6, 4]
    In [31]: reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, l)
    Out[31]: 36


To get the product:
::
    

    In [32]: reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, l)
    Out[32]: 20160



comprehensions
==============
Couldn't you do all this with comprehensions?

Yes:
::
    

    In [33]: [x+2 + 10 for x in l]
    Out[33]: [14, 17, 19, 24, 18, 16]
    In [34]: [x for x in l if not x%2]
    Out[34]: [2, 12, 6, 4]


Except Reduce

But Guido thinks almost all uses of reduce are really ``sum()`` 

functional programming
======================

Comprehensions and map, filter, reduce are all "functional programming" approaches

``map, filter``  and ``reduce``  pre-date comprehensions in Python's history

Some people like that syntax better

And "map-reduce" is a big concept these days for parallel processing of "Big Data" in NoSQL databases.

(Hadoop, MongoDB, etc.) 

lambda
======
Can also use keyword arguments
::
    

    In [186]: l = []
    In [187]: for i in range(3):
        l.append(lambda x, e=i: x**e)
       .....:
    In [189]: for f in l:
        print f(3)
    1
    3
    9


Note when the keyword argument is evaluated: this turns out to be handy

LAB
===


  * Write a function that returns a list of n functions,
such that each one, when called, will return the input value,
incremented by an increasing number.
  * Use a for loop, ``lambda`` , and a keyword argument

===========================
Object Oriented Programming
===========================

Object Oriented Programming
===========================

 More about Python implementation than OO design/strengths/weaknesses

One reason for this:
Folks can't even agree on what OO "really" means

The Quarks of Object-Oriented Development - Deborah J. Armstrong:
http://agp.hx0.ru/oop/quarks.pdf

Object Oriented Programming
===========================

 Is Python a "True" Object-Oriented Language?

(Doesn't support full encapsulation, doesn't require
objects, etc...)

Object Oriented Programming
===========================

 I don't Care!

Good software design is about code re-use, clean separation of concerns,
refactorability, testability, etc...

OO can help with all that, but:

  * It doesn't guarantee it
  * It can get in the way


Object Oriented Programming
===========================

 Python is a Dynamic Language

That clashes with "pure" OO

Think in terms of what makes sense for your project
 -- not any one paradigm of software design.


Object Oriented Programming
===========================

 OO for this class:


"Objects can be thought of as wrapping their data 
within a set of functions designed to ensure that 
the data are used appropriately, and to assist in 
that use"


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming


Object Oriented Programming
===========================

Even simpler:


Objects are data and the functions that act on them in one place.


In Python: just another namespace.


Object Oriented Programming
===========================

The OO buzzwords:


  * data abstraction
  * encapsulation
  * modularity
  * polymorphism
  * inheritance


Object Oriented Programming
===========================

You can do OO in C
(see the GTK+ project)


"OO languages" give you some handy tools to make it easier (and safer):


  * polymorphism (duck typing gives you this anyway)
  * inheritance


Object Oriented Programming
===========================

OO is the dominant model for the past couple decades

You will need to use it:

-- It's a good idea for a lot of problems

-- You'll need to work with OO packages


Object Oriented Programming
===========================

Some definitions
\begin{description
  *[class] A category of objects: particular data and behavior: A "circle" (same as a type in python)
  *[instance] A particular object of a class: a specific circle
  *[object] The general case of a instance -- really any value (in Python anyway)
  *[attribute] Something that belongs to an object (or class)
    -- generally thought of as a variable, or single object, as opposed to a ...
  *[method] A function that belongs to a class
\end{description

==============
Python Classes
==============

Python Classes
==============
The ``class``  statement

``class``  creates a new type object:
::
    

    In [4]: class C(object):
        pass
       ...:
    In [5]: type(C)
    Out[5]: type


It is created when the statement is run -- much like ``def`` 

(note on"new style" classes)

Python Classes
==============
Note about the book (TP):
Chapters 15 and 16 use a style that generally isn't recommended:
::
    

    In [6]: class Point(object):
       ...:     pass
    In [7]: p = Point()
    In [8]: p.x = 4
    In [9]: p.y = 2


Python is Dynamic -- you can do this, but you generally want more structure,
defaults, etc.

(it used to be a quick and dirty "struct"
 -- but use a named tuple now)

Python Classes
==============
About the simplest class:
::
    

    >>> class Point(object):
    ...     x = 1
    ...     y = 2
    >>> Point
    <class __main__.Point at 0x2bf928>
    >>> Point.x
    1
    >>> p = Point()
    >>> p
    <__main__.Point instance at 0x2de918>
    >>> p.x
    1



Python Classes
==============
Basic Structure of a real class:
::
    

    class Point(object):
    # everything defined in here is in the class namespace
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
    ## create an instance of that class
    p = Point(3,4)
    ## access the attributes
    print "p.x is:", p.x
    print "p.y is:", p.y


see: ``code/simple_class``  

Python Classes
==============
The Initializer

The ``__init__``  special method is called when a new instance of a class is created.

You can use it to do any set-up you need

::
    

    class Point(object):
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y



It gets the arguments passed to the class constructor

Python Classes
==============
``self`` 

The instance of the class is passed as the first parameter for every method.

"``self`` " is only a convention -- but you DO want to use it.

::
    

    class Point(object):
        def a_function(self, x, y):
    ...



Does this look familiar from C-style procedural programming?

Python Classes
==============
::
    

    class Point(object):
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y



Anything assigned to a ``self.``  attribute is kept in the instance
name space

That's where all the instance-specific data is.


Python Classes
==============
::
    

    class Point(object):
        size = 4
        color= "red"
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y



Anything assigned in the class scope is a class attribute -- every
instance of the class shares the same one.


Python Classes
==============
::
    

    class Point(object):
        size = 4
        color= "red"
    ...
        def get_color():
            return self.color
    >>> p3.get_color()
     'red'



class attributes are accessed with ``self``  also..


Python Classes
==============
Typical methods
::
    

    class Circle(object):
        color = "red"
        def __init__(self, diameter):
            self.diameter = diameter
        def grow(self, factor=2):
            self.diameter = self.diameter * factor



methods take some parameters, manipulate the attributes in ``self`` 

Python Classes
==============
Gotcha!
::
    

    ...
        def grow(self, factor=2):
            self.diameter = self.diameter * factor
    ...
    In [205]: C = Circle(5)
    In [206]: C.grow(2,3)
    TypeError: grow() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)



Huh???? I only gave 2

("self" is implicitly passed in...)

Let's say you need to render some html...

The goal is to build a set of classes that render an html page:
``sample_html.html`` 


We'll start with a single class, then add some sub-classes to specialize the behavior

More details in ``week-06/LAB_instuctions.rst(html)`` 

LAB
===

Step 1:

  * Create an "Element" class for rendering an html element (xml element).
  * It should have class attributes for the tag name  and the
  indentation
  * the constructor signature should look like:
    ``Element(content=None)``  where content is a string
  * It should have an "append" method that can add another string to the content
  * It should have a ``render(file_out, ind = "")``  method that renders the tag and the strings in the content.
     ``file_out``  could be any file-like object.
     ``ind``  is a string with enough spaces to indent properly.

=======================
Subclassing/Inheritance
=======================

Inheritance
===========
In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a way to reuse code of
existing objects, or to establish a subtype from an existing object.

...

objects are defined by classes, classes can inherit attributes and behavior
from pre-existing classes called base classes, or super classes.

The resulting classes are known as derived classes or subclasses.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29)

Subclassing
===========
A subclass "inherits" all the attributes (methods, etc) of the parent class.

You can then change ("override") some or all of the attributes to change the behavior.

The simplest subclass in Python:
::
    

    class A_Subclass(The_SuperClass):
        pass



``A_subclass``  now has exactly the same behavior as ``The_SuperClass`` 

Overriding attributes
=====================
Overriding is as simple as creating a new attribute with the same name:

::
    

    class Circle(object):
        color = "red"
    ...
    class NewCircle(Circle):
        color = "blue"
    >>> nc = NewCircle
    >>> print nc.color
    blue



all the ``self``  instances will have the new attribute

Overriding methods
==================
Same thing, but with methods

::
    

    class Circle(object):
    ...
        def grow(self, factor=2):
            """grows the circle's diameter by factor"""
            self.diameter = self.diameter * factor
    ...
    class NewCircle(Circle):
    ...
        def grow(self, factor=2):
            """grows the area by factor..."""
            self.diameter = self.diameter * math.sqrt(2)


all the instances will have the new method

frame
=====

"Here's a program design suggestion: whenever you override a method, the
interface of the new method should be the same as the old.  It should take
the same parameters, return the same type, and obey the same preconditions
and postconditions.  If you obey this rule, you will find that any function
designed to work with an instance of a superclass, like a Deck, will also work
with instances of subclasses like a Hand or PokerHand.  If you violate this
rule, your code will collapse like (sorry) a house of cards."


\hfill ThinkPython 18.10

LAB
===

Step 2:

  *  Create a couple subclasses of ``Element`` , for a ``<body>``  tag
         and ``<p>``  tag. Simply override the ``tag``  class attribute.
  * Extend the ``Element.render()``  method so that it can render other
        elements inside the tag in addition to strings. Simple recursion should
        do it. i.e. it can call the ``render()``  method of the elements it
        contains.
  * Deal with the content items that could be either simple strings or
        ``Element`` s with ``render``  methods...there are a few ways to handle that...


LAB
===

Step 3:

  * Create a ``<head>``  element -- simple subclass.
  * Create a ``OneLineTag``  subclass of Element:
        It should override the render method, to render everything on one line --
        for the simple tags, like:
        ``<title> PythonClass - Class 6 example </title>`` 
  * Create a Title subclass of ``OneLineTag``  class for the title.
  * You should now be able to render an html doc with a head element, with
       a ``title``  element in that, and a body element with some ``<P>`` 
       elements and some text.
