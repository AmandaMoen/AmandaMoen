A diversion...
--------------
\Large{A number of you are already using ``iPython`` }

\Large{It's a very useful tool}

\Large{And the ``iPython``  notebook is even cooler .. paticularly for in-class demos.}

\Large{So I'll use it some today:}

http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/notebook.html}

==========
Decorators
==========

Decorators
----------
Decorators are wrappers around functions}

They let you add code before and after the execution of a function}

Creating a custom version of that function}

Decorators
----------
Syntax:}

::
    

    @logged
    def add(a, b):
        """add() adds things"""
        return a + b



Demo and Motivation: 
``code/decorators/basic_math.py [ipnb]``  }

PEP: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/}

Decorators
----------
``@``  decorator operator is an abbreviation:}
{\large

::
    

    @f
    def g:
        pass



same as

::
    

    def g:
        pass
    g = f(g)


}

"Syntactic Sugar" -- but really quite nice}

Decorators
----------
demo:

::
    

    decorator.py


}

Decorator  examples
-------------------
Examples from the stdlib:}

Does this structure:}

::
    

    def g:
        pass
    g = f(g)



look familiar from last class?}

Decorator examples
------------------
``staticmethod()`` }

::
    

    ￼class C(object):
        def add(a, b):
            return a + b
        add = staticmethod(add)



Decorator examples
------------------
``staticmethod()`` }

Decorator form:}
::
    

    ￼class C(object):
        @staticmethod
        def add(a, b):
            return a + b



( and ``classmethod``  )}

examples
--------
``property()`` }

::
    

    ￼￼class C(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self._x = None
        def getx(self):
            return self._x
        def setx(self, value):
            self._x = value
        def delx(self):
            del self._x
        x = property(getx, setx, delx,
                     "I'm the 'x' property.")



becomes...}

Decorator examples
------------------
::
    

    class C(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self._x = None
        @property
        def x(self):
            return self._x
        @x.setter
        def x(self, value):
            self._x = value
        @x.deleter
        def x(self):
            del self._x



Puts the info close to where it is used}

examples
--------
CherryPy}

::
    

    import cherrypy
    class HelloWorld(object):
        @cherrypy.expose
        def index(self):
            return "Hello World!"
    cherrypy.quickstart(HelloWorld())



examples
--------
Pyramid}

::
    

    @template
    def A_view_function(request)
       .....
    @json
    def A_view_function(request)
       ......


so you don't need to think about what your view is returning...

decorators...
-------------
For this class:}

Mostly want to you to know how to use decorators that someone else has written}

Have a basic idea what they do when you do use them}

But writing a couple will help you "get" it, and help cement your Python knowledge...}

Writing Decorators
------------------
So how to you write one?}


demo in iPython notebook

::
    

    code\decorators\DecoratorDemo.py


}

For more detail: (and talks about closures...):}
http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2012/jul/1/python-decorators-in-12-steps/}

LAB
---

  * Re-write the properties from last week's ``Circle``  class
        to use the decorator syntax (see a couple slides back for an example)
        (``circle_properties.py``  and ``test_circle_properties.py`` )
  * Write a decorator that can be used to wrap any function that returns a string in a ``<p>``  element -- auto-generation of simple html.
 (``p_wrapper.py`` )
  * Try using a class to make a decorator that will wrap a
   specified tag around a function that returns a string:
::
    

       @tag_wrapper('h1')
       def func2(x, y=4, z=2):
           return "the sum of %s and %s and %s is %s"%(x, y, z, x+y+z)
       >>> print func2(3,4)
       <h1> the sum of 3 and 4 and 2 is 9 </h1>

Context Managers
================

Context Managers
----------------
the ``with``  statement}

A class with ``__enter__()``  and ``__exit__()``  methods.}

``__enter__()``  is run before your block of code}

``__exit__()``  is run after your block of code}

Can be used to setup/cleanup before and after: open/closing files, db connections, etc}

Context Managers
----------------
"PEP 343: the ``with``  statement"} 
  -- A.M. Kuchling
http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-343-the-with-statement}

"Understanding Python's ``with``  statement"} 
  -- Fredrik Lundh
http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm}

"The Python ``with``  Statement by Example"} 
  -- Jeff Preshing
http://preshing.com/20110920/the-python-with-statement-by-example}

Context Managers
----------------
Use syntax:}
::
    

    with manager as something:
        a = block_of_code
        use_something_here(something)
        ...



{\large
``manager``  is the context manager: i.e. has an ``__enter__``  and ``__exit__``  method -- if ``__enter__``  returns an object, it gets assigned to ``something`` 
}


Context Managers
----------------
The file object is also a context manager:}
::
    

    with open(filename) as the_file:
        for line in the_file:
            work_with(line)
            ...
         ...



In this case, the file will automatically be closed when you leave that block, regardless of errors, etc.}

Most commonly used context manager -- by far!}

Context Managers
----------------
You also may hav seen this in some of my unit tests:}
::
    

    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        some_test_code_here
        1/0



Context Managers can also catch Exceptions....}


LAB
---
See if you can write a context manger that will time some code.}
When using it, you can do:}
::
    

      with timer:
          this_is_some_code_to_run()
          how_long_might_it_take


and you'll get something like:}
::
    

      this code took 0.12 seconds



See: ``context_manager\timer_context.html``  (``timer_context.py`` ) }

Packages and Packaging
======================

Modules and Packages
--------------------

A module is a file with python code in it}

A package is a directory with an ``__init__.py``  file in it}

And usually other modules, packages, etc...}
::
    

    my_package
        __init__.py
        module_a.py
        module_b.py


::
    

    import my_package


runs ``my_package/__init__.py``

Modules and Packages
--------------------

::
    

    import sys
    for p in sys.path:
        print p



(demo)

Installing Python
-----------------
Linux:}
Usually part of the system -- just use it

Windows:}

Use the python.org} version:

System Wide

Can install multiple versions if need be

Third party binaries for it.

Installing Python
-----------------
OS-X:}
Comes with the system, but:

    * Apple has never upgraded within a release
    * There are non-open source components
    * Third party packages may or may not support it
    * Apple does use it -- so don't mess with it.
    * I usually recommend the python.org} version

(Also Macports, Fink, Home Brew...)


Distributions
-------------

There are also a few "curated" distributions:}

These provide python and a package management system for hard-to-buid packages.}

Widely used by the scipy community (lots of hard to build stuff that needs to work together...)}
{\large

  * Anoconda (https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/})
  * Canopy (https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/})
  * ActivePython (http://www.activestate.com/activepython})

}

Installing Packages
-------------------
Every Python installation has its own stdlib and ``site-packages``  folder}

``site-packages``  is the default place for third-party packages}

Finding Packages
----------------
The Python Package Index:}

PyPi}

http://pypi.python.org/pypi}

Installing Packages
-------------------
From source}
(``setup.py install`` )

With the system installer (apt-get, yum, etc...)}

From binaries: }

Windows:} MSI installers

OS-X:} dmg installers

And now:} binary wheels
(make sure to get compatible packages)

``easy_install``  and ``pip`` }

Installing Packages
-------------------
In the beginning, there was the ``distutils`` :}
....}
But ``distutils``  is missing some key features:}

  * package versioning
  * package discovery
  * auto-install


- And then came ``PyPi`` }

- And then came ``setuptools`` }

- But that wasn't well maintained...}

- Then there was ``distribute/pip`` }

- Which has now been merged back into ``setuptools`` }

Installing Packages
-------------------

Actually, it's still a bit of a mess}

But getting better...}

Packaging Time line
-------------------

\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{PackagingTimeline.pdf}
}

Packaging Tools
---------------

\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{packaging1.pdf}
}

Current State of Packaging
--------------------------

To build packages: distutils}
http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/}

For more features: setuptools}
http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/}

To install packages: pip}
http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/}

For binary packages: wheels}
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/}

Compiled Packages
-----------------
Biggest issue is with compiled extensions
\hfill(C/C++, etc)\hfill
}

-- You need the right compiler set up}

Dependencies}

-- Here's were it gets really ugly}

-- Particularly on Windows}

Compiled Packages
-----------------
Linux}

Pretty straightforward:}

1) Is there a system package 
}

2) Install the dependencies, build from source:
``python setup.py build ; python setup.py install`` 

( Or maybe ``pip install``  will just work )
}

Compiled Packages
-----------------
Windows}

Sometimes simpler:}

1) A lot of packages have Windows binaries:
            - Usually for python.org} builds 
            - Excellent source:} http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/} 
           - Make sure you get 32 or 64 bit consistent
}

2) But if no binaries: 
           - Hope the dependencies are available!
           - Set up the compiler (MS VS2008 Express works)
}

Compiled Packages
-----------------
OS-X}

Lots of Python versions:
  - Apple's built-in (different for each version of OS)
  - python.org} builds.
  - 32 bit PPC+Intel
  - 32+64 bit Intel
  - Macports
  - Homebrew
}

Binary Installers (dmg or wheel) have to match python version}

Compiled Packages
-----------------
OS-X}

If you have to build it yourself:}

Xcode compiler (the right version):
  - Version 3.* for 32 bit PPC+Intel
  - Version 4.* for 32+64 bit Intel
}

If extra dependencies:
  - macports or home brew often easiest way to build them
}

Final Recommendation
--------------------
First try: ``pip install`` }

If that doesn't work:}

Read the docs of the package you want to install}

Do what they say}

virtualenv
----------
``virtualenv``  is a tool to create isolated Python environments.}

Very useful for developing multiple apps}

Or deploying more than one on one system}

http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html}

(Cris will get into more detail with this next class)

============
Distributing
============

Distributing
------------
What if you need to distribute you own:}

Scripts}

Libraries }

Applications }


Scripts
-------

Often you can just copy, share, or check in the script to source
control and call it good.}

But only if it's a single file, and doesn't need anything non-standard}

Scripts
-------

￼When the script needs more than just the stdlib
 (or your company standard environment)}

You have an application, not a script}


Libraries
---------

When you read the distutils docs, it's usually libraries they're talking about}

Scripts + library is the same...}

(http://docs.python.org/distutils/})

distutils
---------

``distutils``  makes it easy to do the easy stuff:}

Distribute and install to multiple platforms, etc.}

Even binaries, installers and compiled packages}

(Except dependencies)}

(http://docs.python.org/distutils/})

distutils basics
----------------

It's all in the ``setup.py file`` :}
::
    

    from distutils.core import setup
    setup(name='Distutils',
          version='1.0',
          description='Python Distribution Utilities',
          author='Greg Ward',
          author_email='gward@python.net',
          url='http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/',
          packages=['distutils', 'distutils.command'],
         )



(http://docs.python.org/distutils/})

distutils basics
----------------
Once your setup.py is written, you can:}
::
    

    python setup.py ...
    build         build everything needed to install
    install       install everything from build directory
    sdist         create a source distribution
                  (tarball, zip file, etc.)
    bdist         create a built (binary) distribution
    bdist_rpm     create an RPM distribution
    bdist_wininst create an executable installer for MS Windows
    upload        upload binary package to PyPI



More complex packaging
----------------------
For a complex package:}

You want to use a well structured setup:}

http://guide.python-distribute.org/creation.html}


develop mode
------------
While you are developing your package, Installing it is a pain.}

But you want your code to be able to import, etc. as though it were installed}

``setup.py develop``  installs links to your code, rather than copies
 -- so it looks like it's installed, but it's using the original source}

``python setup.py develop`` }

You need ``setuptools``  to use it.}


Applications
------------
For a complete application:}

  * Web apps
  * GUI apps

Multiple options:}

  * Virtualenv + VCS
  * zc.buildout ( http://www.buildout.org/} )
  * System packages (rpm, deb, ...)
  * Bundles...


Bundles
-------

Bundles are Python + all your code + plus all the dependencies --
all in one single "bundle"

Most popular on Windows and OS-X
}
::
    

      py2exe
      py2app
      pyinstaller
     ...


User doesn't even have to know it's python }

Examples: 
 http://www.bitpim.org/} 
 http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/nucos}

LAB
---
Write a setup.py for a script of yours}

  * Ideally, your script relies on at least one other module
  * At a minimum, you'll need to specify ``scripts`` 
  * and probably ``py_modules`` 
  * try:
  
    * `` python setup.py build`` 
    * `` python setup.py install`` 
    * `` python setup.py sdist`` 
    * `` python setup.py bdist_wininst`` 
  
  * EXTRA: install ``setuptools`` 
  
    * use: ``from setuptools import setup`` 
    * try: `` python setup.py develop`` 
  

(my example: capitalize Package)
