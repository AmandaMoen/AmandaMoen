Chris' History
--------------
Discovered Python in 1998

    * It could do what Perl could do,
    
        * what TCL could do, what MATLAB could do,
    
    * But I liked it -- it fit my brain


    My Python use now:

   * Lots of text file crunching / data processing
   * Desktop GUIs (wxPython)
   * computational code
   * wrapping C/C++ code
   * web apps (Pylons, Pyramid)
   * GIS processing
   * Ask me about "BILS"


Who are you?

Lightning Talks
---------------
Lightning Talks

   * 5 minutes (including setup) - no kidding!
   * Every student will give one
   * Purposes: introduce yourself, share interests, also show Python applications
   * Any topic you like, that is related to Python -- according to you!


Mailing list and Office Hours
-----------------------------

We've set up a google group
 -- you will all be invited to join.
programming-in-python@googlegroups.com

"Office Hours" 
-- Useful? Will you come?


Python Ecosystem
----------------
Used for:

  * CS education (this course!)
  * Application scripting (GIS, GNU Radio, Blender...)
  * Systems administration and "glue"
  * Web applications (Django etc. etc. etc.)
  * Scientific/technical computing (a la MATLAB, Mathematica, also BioPython etc. ..)
  * Software tools (automated software testing, distributed version control, ...)
  * Research (natural language, graph theory, distributed computing, ...)

 An unusually large number of niches -- versatile

Python Ecosystem
----------------
Used by:

  * Beginners
  * Professional software developers, computer system administrators, ...
  * Professionals OTHER THAN computer specialists: biologists, urban planners, ....


 An unusually large number of types of users -- versatile
 You can be productive in Python WITHOUT full-time immersion!

Python Features
---------------
Gets many things right:

  *  Readable -- looks nice, makes sense
  *  No ideology about best way to program --
   object-oriented programming,  functional, etc.
  *  No platform preference -- Windows, Mac, Linux, ...
  *  Easy to connect to other languages -- C, Fortran - essential for science/math
  *  Large standard library
  *  Even larger network of external packages
  *  Countless conveniences, large and small, make it pleasant to work with


===============
What is Python?
===============

What is Python?
---------------
    
      * Dynamic
      * Object oriented
      * Byte-compiled
      * interpreted
      * ....
    

Python Features
---------------
Features:

  *  Unlike C, C++, C\#, Java ... More like Ruby, Lisp, Perl, Matlab, Mathematica ...
  *  Dynamic - no type declarations
    
      * programs are shorter
      * programs are more flexible
      * less code means fewer bugs
    
  *  Interpreted - no separate compile, build steps - programming process is simpler


What's a Dynamic language
-------------------------
{Strong, Dynamic typing.
 - Type checking and dispatch happen at run-time

``X = A+B`` 


  * What is A?
  * What is B?
  * What does it mean to add them?


  * A and B can change at any time before this process


Duck Typing
-----------

 "If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck -- it's probably a duck"


 If an object behaves as expected at run-time, it's the right type.

Python Versions
---------------
Python 2.*
"Classic" Python -- evolved from original

Python 3.* ("py3k")
Updated version -- removed the "warts" allowed to break code
(but really not all that different)
Adoption is growing fast, but a few key packages still not supported.
(https://python3wos.appspot.com/)

This program uses Python 2.7 not Python 3 (next year?)

Implementations
---------------

    * Jython (JVM)
    * Iron Python (.NET)
    * PyPy -- Python written in Python (actually RPy...)


  We will use CPython 2.7 from python.org for this course.

A Tiny Bit of History
---------------------
Invented/developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989 -- first version was written on
a Mac. Time of origin similar to TCL and Perl.

Using Python
------------
{All you need for Python:

  *  A good programmer's text editor
    
      * Good Python mode
      * Particularly indentation!
    
  *  The command line to run code
  *  The interactive shell
    
      * regular interpreter
      * ``IPython``  is an excellent enhancement
        http://ipython.org/
    

There are lots of Editors, IDES, etc.:
   maybe you'll find one you like.

Running Python Code
-------------------

  * At an interpreter prompt:
::
    

         $ python
         >>> print 'Hello, world!'
         Hello, world!



Running Python Modules
----------------------
Running Modules
-- a file that contains Python code, filename ends with ``.py`` 
 
    * ``$ python hello.py``   -- must be in current working directory
    * ``$ python -m hello``   -- any module on PYTHONPATH anywhere on the system
    * ``$ ./hello.py``        -- put ``#!/usr/env/python``  at top of module (Unix)
    * ``$ python -i hello.py``   -- import module, remain in interactive session
    * ``>>> import hello``     -- at the python prompt -- importing a module executes its contents
    * ``run hello.py``     -- at the IPython prompt -- running a module brings the names into the interactive namespace


Documentation
-------------
www.python.org docs:
http://docs.python.org/index.html

Particularly the library reference:
http://docs.python.org/library/index.html

(The tutorial is pretty good, too)

PEPs
----
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/ 

\begin{description
  *[PEP 1]   PEP Purpose and Guidelines
  *[PEP 8]   Style Guide for Python Code
  *[PEP 20]  the Zen of Python (``import this`` )
\end{description

pydoc
-----
{Suite of tools for processing "docstrings"
And an online source at the interpreter:
::
    

    >>> from pydoc import help
    >>> help(int)
    Help on class int in module __builtin__:
    class int(object)
     |  int(x[, base]) -> integer
     |
     |  Convert a string or number to an integer, if possible.  A floating point
     ...


or: ``$ pydoc``
(but I prefer IPython's  ``?`` )

Documentation
-------------
{\LARGEï¿¼google

But  be careful!

Lots of great info out there!

Most of it is opinionated and out of date.
(might still be correct, though!)

Getting everyone on-line and at a command line.

    * Do a ``git clone``  of the project
    * Start up the Python interpreter:
          ``$ python``  [``ctrl+D``  (``ctrl+Z``  on Windows)or ``exit()``  to exit]
    * Run ``hello.py``  (in the ``week-01/code``  dir)
    * Open ``hello.py``  in your editor, change it, and save it.
    
        * (Optional) Start up ``IPython``  
          ``$ ipython``  ( also ``ctrl+D`` , etc. to exit )
         * Run ``hello.py``  in ``IPython`` 
         * use ``?``  in ``IPython``  on anything...

==============================
Values, Expressions, and Types
==============================

Code structure
--------------

Each line is a piece of code

{Comments: everything following a ``#``  is a comment

{Expression: something that results in a value: ``3+4`` 

{Statement: Line of code that does not return a value: 
        ``print "this"`` 

Blocks of code are delimited by a colon and indentation:
::
    

    def a_function():
        a_new_code_block
    end_of_the_block



The print statement
-------------------
{\large
Kind of obvious, but handy when playing with code:

``print something``  prints ``something``  to the console.

Can print multiple things: ``print "the value is", 5`` 

Automatically adds a newline.

You can suppress the newline with a comma: 
``print "the value is",`` 
``print 5`` 

Any python object can be printed
(though it might not be pretty...)


Values, expressions, and types
------------------------------
Values (data) vs. variables (names with values)

    *  Values are pieces of unnamed data: ``42, 'Hello, world',`` 
    *  In Python, all values are objects
      Try ``dir(42)``  - lots going on behind the curtain! (demo)
    *  Every value belongs to a type: integer, float, str, ...  (demo)
    *  An expression is made up of values and operators, is evaluated to
        produce a value:  ``2 + 2`` , etc.
    *  Python interpreter can be used as a calculator to evaluate expressions (demo)
    *  Integer vs. float arithmetic (demo)
    *  Type errors - checked at run time only (demo)
    *  Type conversions (demo)


Variables
---------
Variables are names for values (objects)
-- Variables don't have a type; values do --
this is where the dynamic comes from
::
    

    ï¿¼>>> type(42)
    <type 'int'>
    >>> type(3.14)
    <type 'float'>
    >>> a = 42
    >>> b = 3.14
    >>> type(a)
    <type 'int'>
    >>> a = b
    >>> type(a)
    <type 'float'>



Assignment
----------
Assignment is really name binding: 

  * Attaching a name to a value
  * A value can have many names (or none!)


``=``  assigns (binds a name)

``+=``  also an assignment: ``a += 1``  same as ``a = a+1`` 
also: ``-=, *=, /=, **=, \%=`` 
(not quite -- really in-place assignment for mutables....)

Multiple Assignment
-------------------
You can assign multiple variables from multiple expressions in one statement

``i, j = 2 + x,  3 * y``  \# commas separate variables on lhs, exprs on rhs

Python evaluates all the expressions on the right before doing any assignments

``i, j = j, i``  \# parlor trick: swap in one statement

\large{These are just tricks, but multiple assignment is more helpful in other contexts

(more on what's really going on later...)

(demo)

Deleting
--------
You can't actually delete anything in python...

``del``  only unbinds a name

::
    

    a = 5
    b = a
    del a


The object is still there...python will only delete it if there are no references to it.

(demo)

equality and identity
---------------------
{\large

``==``  checks equality

``is``  checks identity

``id()``  queries identity


(demo)

Operator Precedence
-------------------
{Operator Precedence determines what evaluates first:
``4 + 3 * 5 != (4 + 3) * 5``   --  Use parentheses !
Precedence of common operators:
Arithmetic 
``**``  
``+x, -x``  
``*, /, %`` 	
``+, -``  
Comparisons:
``<, <=, >, >=, !=, ==`` 
Boolean operators:
``or, and, not`` 
Membership and Identity:
``in, not in, is, is not`` 

string literals
---------------
::
    

    'a string'
    "also a string"
    "a string with an apostophe: isn't it cool?"
    ' a string with an embedded "quote" '
    """ a multi-line
    string
    all in one
    """
    "a string with an \n escaped character"
    r'a "raw" string the \n comes through as a \n'



key words
---------
 A bunch:

::
    

    and       del       from      not       while
    as        elif      global    or        with
    assert    else      if        pass      yield
    break     except    import    print
    class     exec      in        raise
    continue  finally   is        return
    def       for       lambda    try



and the built-ins..
-------------------
 Try this:

``>>> dir(__builtins__)``

=========
Functions
=========

Functions
---------

What is a function?

A function is a self-contained chunk of code

You use them when you need the same code to run multiple times,
or in multiple parts of the program.
(DRY) 

Or just to keep the code clean

Functions can take and return information

Functions
---------
Minimal Function does nothing
::
    

    ï¿¼def <name>():
        <statement>



Pass Statement (Note the indentation!)
::
    

    ï¿¼def <name>():
        pass



Functions: def
--------------
``def``  is a statement:

  * it is executed
  * it creates a local variable

{\largeï¿¼function defs must be executed before the functions can be called

{\largeï¿¼functions call functions -- this makes a stack -- that's all a trace back is

Functions: Call Stack
---------------------
::
    

    def exceptional():
        print "I am exceptional!"
        print 1/0
    def passive():
        pass
    def doer():
        passive()
        exceptional()



Functions: Tracebacks
---------------------
::
    

    I am exceptional!
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "functions.py", line 15, in <module>
        doer()
      File "functions.py", line 12, in doer
        exceptional()
      File "functions.py", line 5, in exceptional
        print 1/0
    ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero



Functions: return
-----------------
Every function ends with a ``return`` 
::
    

    def five():
        return 5


Actually simplest function
::
    

    def fun():
        return None



Functions: return
-----------------
if you don't put ``return``  there, python will:
::
    

    In [123]: def fun():
       .....:     pass
    In [124]: result = fun()
    In [125]: print result
    None


note that the interpreter eats ``None`` 

Functions: return
-----------------

Only one return statement will ever be executed.


Ever.


Anything after a executed return statement will never get run.

ï¿¼This is useful when debugging! 

Functions: return
-----------------
functions can return multiple results
::
    

    def fun():
        return 1,2,3
    In [149]: fun()
    Out[149]: (1, 2, 3)



Functions: return
-----------------
remember multiple assignment?
::
    

    In [150]: x,y,z = fun()
    In [151]: x
    Out[151]: 1
    In [152]: y
    Out[152]: 2
    In [153]: z
    Out[153]: 3



Functions: parameters
---------------------
function parameters: in definition
::
    

    def fun(x, y, z):
         q = x + y + z
         print x, y, z, q


x, y, z are local names -- so is q

Functions: arguments
--------------------
function arguments: when calling
::
    

    def fun(x, y, z):
         print x, y, z


::
    

    In [138]: fun(3, 4, 5)
    3 4 5



Functions: local vs. global
---------------------------
::
    

    x = 32
    y = 33
    z = 34
    def fun(y, z):
         print x, y, z


::
    

    In [141]: fun(3,4)
    32 3 4


x is global, y, z are local

Functions: local vs. global
---------------------------
::
    

    x = 3
    def f():
        y = x
        x = 5
        print x
        print y


What happens when we call ``f()`` ?

Functions: local vs. global
---------------------------
Gotcha!
::
    

    In [134]: f()
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    UnboundLocalError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
    /Users/Chris/<ipython-input-132-9225fa53a20a> in f()
          1 def f():
    ----> 2     y = x
          3     x = 5
          4     print x
          5     print y


you are going to assign x -- so it's local

Scopes
------

{\Largeï¿¼There is a ``global``  statement


Don't use it!

Scopes
------

{\Largeï¿¼good discussion of scopes:

http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#python-Â­âscopes-Â­âand-Â­ânamespaces

Recursion
---------

{\Largeï¿¼Recursion is calling a function from itself.

{\Largeï¿¼Max stack depth, function call overhead.

{\Largeï¿¼Because of these two(?), recursion isn't used {that often in Python.

Lab: functions
--------------
write a function that:

  * takes a number and returns the square and cube of that number
   -- use variables to store the results
  * takes a string and a number, and returns a new string containing the input string repeated the given number of times
  * calls another function to do part of its job.
